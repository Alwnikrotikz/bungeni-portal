This is a (hopefully short-lived) fork of
svn://svn.zope.org/repos/main/CMF/trunk/DCWorkflow

It exists only for the backport of the patch to introduce events to
workflow. See http://svn.zope.org/CMF/trunk/?rev=71686&view=rev

There is some documentation in the 'doc' directory.

I encourage you to experiment with what's available and invite you to
ask questions about the tool on zope-cmf@zope.org.  Future development
depends entirely on people's needs, so speak up!
