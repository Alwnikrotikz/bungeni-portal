                        <b><span refersTo="mrspeaker">Mr. Speaker</span></b>:
                    </from>
                    <p> Your Excellency the President, hon. Members, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, 
                        it is my pleasure, privilege and honour to address the House on this auspicious occasion 
                        of the Official State Opening of the Tenth Parliament. 
                        I must, however, hasten to note that the occasion is, unfortunately, clouded, coming against the backdrop 
                        of the loss of two hon. Members, namely, the hon. Member for Embakasi, Mr. <span refersTo="mw">Melitus Were</span> and the hon. 
                        Member for Ainamoi, Mr. <span refersTo="dkt">David Kimutai Too</span>, through murders most foul since the inauguration on 15th January, 2008.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	It is regrettable that the two hon. Members lost their lives without addressing this House even for a single moment.
                    	This House, and indeed the entire country, hopes that the two murders shall be fully investigated with speed so 
                    	that the culprits are brought to book. This will go some way in helping law enforcement agencies regain public 
                    	confidence in the ability to protect the people and their property. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	All of us are aware that this has been an exceptionally difficult year for our country. 
                    	No sooner had the results of the last general elections been announced than unprecedented mayhem ensued 
                    	in several parts of the country. Most, if not all of us, have thus not been able to enjoy and celebrate our victory 
                    	at the polls as is typical of us. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    	The irony of events as have taken place in Kenya is that several African countries which have had political 
                    	upheavals were assisted by the international community to conduct credible general elections as a means of 
                    	resolving their conflicts. It is because armed conflicts in Africa have tended to beset those countries 
                    	where the leaders erroneously believe that seeking the mandate to govern from the governed 
                    	is a luxury they can ill-afford. 
                    	In contrast, the Kenyan conflict was triggered by events which took place after the people had successfully 
                    	voted for their preferred candidates in the elections. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hon. Members, it is for the foregoing reason that I would like to take this unique opportunity to congratulate 
                        all of you for having won your seats in the most competitive and yet, divisive and acrimonious elections Kenya 
                        has ever witnessed. For the first time in our history since 1963, the foundation of our nation faced a real threat. 
                        It appeared at times as if the forces of disintegration and disunity were too powerful for us to manage and control. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That the worst did not happen is due mainly to the tenacity of our people and their true love for this beautiful 
                        country which God created and bestowed upon us. We cannot also forget to commend our leaders, both temporal and 
                        spiritual, for having stood firm to defend and protect our national integrity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Hon. Members, I have no appropriate words to commend our two heroes whose heads remain high above all the din and 
                        dint that characterised our public life to stay the course steadily and make great sacrifices even at the expense 
                        of disappointing their closest friends, supporters and admirers across the country.
                    </p>
