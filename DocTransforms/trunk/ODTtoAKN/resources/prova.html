                        </b>:</span>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">Your Excellency the President, hon. Members, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure, privilege and honour to address the House on this auspicious occasion of the Official State Opening of the Tenth Parliament. I must, however, hasten to note that the occasion is, unfortunately, clouded, coming against the backdrop of the loss of two hon. Members, namely, the hon. Member for Embakasi, Mr.<span class="html_inline" name="">Melitus Were</span>and the hon. Member for Ainamoi, Mr.<span class="html_inline" name="">David Kimutai Too</span>, through murders most foul since the inauguration on 15th January, 2008.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">It is regrettable that the two hon. Members lost their lives without addressing this House even for a single moment. This House, and indeed the entire country, hopes that the two murders shall be fully investigated with speed so that the culprits are brought to book. This will go some way in helping law enforcement agencies regain public confidence in the ability to protect the people and their property.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">All of us are aware that this has been an exceptionally difficult year for our country. No sooner had the results of the last general elections been announced than unprecedented mayhem ensued in several parts of the country. Most, if not all of us, have thus not been able to enjoy and celebrate our victory at the polls as is typical of us.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">The irony of events as have taken place in Kenya is that several African countries which have had political upheavals were assisted by the international community to conduct credible general elections as a means of resolving their conflicts. It is because armed conflicts in Africa have tended to beset those countries where the leaders erroneously believe that seeking the mandate to govern from the governed is a luxury they can ill-afford. In contrast, the Kenyan conflict was triggered by events which took place after the people had successfully voted for their preferred candidates in the elections.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">Hon. Members, it is for the foregoing reason that I would like to take this unique opportunity to congratulate all of you for having won your seats in the most competitive and yet, divisive and acrimonious elections Kenya has ever witnessed. For the first time in our history since 1963, the foundation of our nation faced a real threat. It appeared at times as if the forces of disintegration and disunity were too powerful for us to manage and control.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">That the worst did not happen is due mainly to the tenacity of our people and their true love for this beautiful country which God created and bestowed upon us. We cannot also forget to commend our leaders, both temporal and spiritual, for having stood firm to defend and protect our national integrity.</p>
                     <p class="html_paragraph">Hon. Members, I have no appropriate words to commend our two heroes whose heads remain high above all the din and dint that characterised our public life to stay the course steadily and make great sacrifices even at the expense of disappointing their closest friends, supporters and admirers across the country.</p>
