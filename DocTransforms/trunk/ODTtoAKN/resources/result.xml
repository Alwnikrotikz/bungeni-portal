            <block name="p" id="d3e305" class="P1">Your Excellency the President, hon. Members,
               distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, it is my pleasure, privilege and honour
               to address the House on this auspicious occasion of the Official State Opening of the
               Tenth Parliament. I must, however, hasten to note that the occasion is,
               unfortunately, clouded, coming against the backdrop of the loss of two hon. Members,
               namely, the hon. Member for Embakasi, Mr. Melitus Were and the hon. Member for
               Ainamoi, Mr. David Kimutai Too, through murders most foul since the inauguration on
               15th January, 2008.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e308" class="P1"> It is regrettable that the two hon. Members lost
               their lives without addressing this House even for a single moment. This House, and
               indeed the entire country, hopes that the two murders shall be fully investigated
               with speed so that the culprits are brought to book. This will go some way in helping
               law enforcement agencies regain public confidence in the ability to protect the
               people and their property.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e313" class="P1"> All of us are aware that this has been an
               exceptionally difficult year for our country. No sooner had the results of the last
               general elections been announced than unprecedented mayhem ensued in several parts of
               the country. Most, if not all of us, have thus not been able to enjoy and celebrate
               our victory at the polls as is typical of us.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e319" class="P1"> The irony of events as have taken place in Kenya
               is that several African countries which have had political upheavals were assisted by
               the international community to conduct credible general elections as a means of
               resolving their conflicts. It is because armed conflicts in Africa have tended to
               beset those countries where the leaders erroneously believe that seeking the mandate
               to govern from the governed is a luxury they can ill-afford. In contrast, the Kenyan
               conflict was triggered by events which took place after the people had successfully
               voted for their preferred candidates in the elections.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e324" class="P1"> Hon. Members, it is for the foregoing reason
               that I would like to take this unique opportunity to congratulate all of you for
               having won your seats in the most competitive and yet, divisive and acrimonious
               elections Kenya has ever witnessed. For the first time in our history since 1963, the
               foundation of our nation faced a real threat. It appeared at times as if the forces
               of disintegration and disunity were too powerful for us to manage and
               control.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e329" class="P1"> That the worst did not happen is due mainly to
               the tenacity of our people and their true love for this beautiful country which God
               created and bestowed upon us. We cannot also forget to commend our leaders, both
               temporal and spiritual, for having stood firm to defend and protect our national
               integrity.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e334" class="P1"> Hon. Members, I have no appropriate words to
               commend our two heroes whose heads remain high above all the din and dint that
               characterised our public life to stay the course steadily and make great sacrifices
               even at the expense of disappointing their closest friends, supporters and admirers
               across the country.</block>

            </container>
            <block name="p" id="d3e355" class="P1">This they this did with one very important
               message: None of us is better than all of us. This was<milestone name="eol"
                  id="d3e357"/>an active demonstration that Kenya is bigger than any single one of
               us.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e360" class="P1"> As some leaders across the political divide
               sometimes issued inflammatory statements in the Press and hurled political insults at
               their opponents in public meetings, the two leaders cooled down political
               temperatures by assuring the public of their personal commitment to seek peaceful
               means to resolve the violent</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e365" class="P1">conflict that had suddenly broken out in many
               parts of the country. By the sheer weight of their personality, political acumen,
               honed skills on statecraft and their deep sense of responsibility, patriotism and
               statesmanship, they finally prevailed upon their supporters to respect each other and
               regard themselves as Kenyans. This is no mean achievement!</block>

            <block name="p" id="d3e370" class="P9"> </block>
            <container BungeniSpeechBy="userSpeaker" BungeniSpeechID="3882" id="comment9838"

            </container>

            <block name="p" id="d3e384" class="P1"> One would be extremely naive, disingenuous and
               callous not to give credit due to President Mwai Kibaki and hon. Raila Odinga for
               sacrificing their personal egos, to grant peace a chance and save Kenya from the
               political morass it had suddenly descended into. The two leaders have shown the world
               that, whereas it is our right to participate in any political competition, we must
               always close ranks and co-operate with one another if the integrity of our beloved
               country is at stake.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e389" class="P1"> The action of the two leaders has created a new
               political reality - that while all of us many not win in an election, all of us do
               not have to lose just because any one of us did not win. We must create, develop and
               promote a political culture where the winner does not take everything and the loser
               remains with nothing including their dignity. This is possible if the political
               playing field is level and there is a strong democratic culture in our
               country.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e394" class="P1"> Last but not least, let me commend the Group of
               Eminent Persons led by His Excellency, Dr. Kofi Annan, the immediate former United
               Nations (UN) Secretary-General together with Her Excellency Gracia Machel Mandela of
               South Africa and His Excellency Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania. Their tireless efforts
               were generously supported by both the immediate and past African Union (AU) Chairmen,
               namely His Excellency John Kuffuor of Ghana and His Excellency Jakaya Kikwete of
               Tanzania, respectively, the President of Uganda, the United Nations, the European
               Union and its representatives in Kenya, the United States of America, the African
               Union and several international organisations and Kenya's development partners,
               especially embassies and missions based in Nairobi.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e399" class="P1"> The clear message they sent to the Kenyan people
               and their leaders made several people confident that we were not alone. Indeed, in
               the current globalised world, international goodwill is an indispensable asset that
               no country can afford to ignore, not even the most powerful country in the
               world.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e405" class="P1"> Hon. Members, in conclusion, let me observe the
               following sad facts about our country: The recent events have exposed the fault-lines
               in our system of governance. Kenyans went to the polls and voted largely freely and
               without compulsion. The genesis of the problems that afflicted the nation would
               appear to have had its epicentre at the Electoral Commission Headquarters. The
               situation dictates an evaluation of our electoral unit. I have this very humble
               submission to make: Democracy is not made by God, but by man. Everything created by
               man is normally brittle, fragile, frail and, therefore, can easily break and be
               destroyed completely.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e410" class="P1"> Yes, we may believe and insist that building
               strong institutions is a prerequisite for establishing a functional democratic
               society, but the truth is that if Kenyans genuinely want to live in a multiparty
               democratic State, we must nurture democracy in our hearts and minds. Democracy must
               be part of our culture and upbringing. It must be in our homes, families and in
               schools. It must be in our offices and other workplaces. We must, therefore, be
               tolerant and prepared to accommodate and glorify our cultural differences, social
               diversity, economic variety and political pluralism. This is the path we must follow
               if it is really our desire that democracy<milestone name="eol" id="d3e414"/>thrives
               in Kenya.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e417" class="P1"> Hon. Members, let me finally</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e422" class="P1">reiterate what I said on the day of my election
               to the Chair. I promise, once again, to abide by the Standing Orders of the National
               Assembly while presiding over the proceedings of the House. I shall apply the rules
               of the House fairly and firmly and interpret them in the most transparent and
               accountable manner. I would like to urge the newly-elected hon. Members to quickly
               acquaint themselves withthese rules of debate, so that they are able to participate
               effectively in the proceedings of the House.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e427" class="P1"> At this moment in our history, Parliament must
               stand tall and high to make Kenyans proud. There is no time in our country when the
               institution has been required to defend the dignity and the integrity of its citizens
               more than now. Never before has the House been expected to show leadership by
               reconciling our people and giving them hope than at this moment in time. If
               Parliament descends into anarchy, despondency, despair, hopelessness and behaves like
               a rudderless vessel in the ocean, then the Kenyan nation will not just sink, it will
               drown.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e432" class="P1"> The people of Kenya are going to watch us as
               their leaders and analyse every word uttered by every hon. Member. Remember, and I
               say this with all the humility that I can command, another set of five years is not
               so distant. Voters shall once again get a chance to audit and vet the Membership of
               this House thoroughly. They are now in Kenya renown for their very effective
               cost-profit analysis of political representation. Constantly bear in mind, hon.
               Members, that every day you come to the august House, that the Kenyan elector as
               empowered, votes without fear or favour, and many of us owe our presence here today
               to that trait.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e438" class="P1"> With those few remarks, it is my pleasure to
               invite His Excellency the President to address the House and inaugurate the Second
               Session of the Tenth Parliament.</block>
            <block name="p" id="d3e443" class="P1"> Thank you and may God bless Kenya.</block>

            are the late Member of Parliament for Embakasi Constituency, hon. Melitus Mugabe Were,
            and the late Member of Parliament for Ainamoi Constituency, hon. David Kimutai Too, who

            a challenging two months period since the 27th December, 2007 General Elections. The
            post-election violence that saw more than 1,000 people killed, over 300,000 people
            displaced and billions of shillings worth of property burnt or looted, shook our sense
            of nationhood. I ask you, once again, to rise and join<milestone name="eol" id="d3e549"

            the post-election violence disrupted lives and destroyed farms, businesses and
            residential properties. We cannot watch our brothers and sisters endure such
            hardships.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e580" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, my Government has set up a
            NationalHumanitarian Assistance Fund with an initial endowment of Kshs1 billion to
            provide humanitarian assistance and resettle the displaced persons. We have also
            established a new Directorate for Resettlement that will oversee the resettlement of
            Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs). Those institutions will assist IDPs in farming
            areas to regain their livelihoods through the provision of free seeds and other farming
            inputs. We are also designing an emergency programme for economic reconstruction and
            restoration.</block>

         <block name="p" id="d3e604" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the programme will mobilize
            resources locally and internationally to be used in repairing and reconstructing
            infrastructure that was badly damaged during the violence.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e609" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the recent crisis has caused me
            to reflect deeply on the half a century of my active participation in the management of
            our public affairs. During this time, I have come to appreciate and respect the
            resilience of our people and our country. I have seen Kenya go through some very
            critical moments. Each time, our people have used the crisis as a crucial turning point
            from which they have come out more focused and determined to stay on course, so as to
            realize our collective vision of a free, just and prosperous nation.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e614" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the events of the last two months
            have offered us an opportunity to look inwards, in order to fully comprehend the
            weaknesses and strengths, as well as the strengths and opportunities that we have as a
            nation. Indeed, Kenyans will always prefer peace over conflict, prosperity over
            desolation, unity over discord and justice over injustice. That is why on 28th February,
            2008, I and hon. Raila Odinga accepted and signed the National Accord because our people
            had spoken clearly that they wanted one Kenya - a Kenya in which all lived in peace,
            justice and harmony.</block>

         </container>
         <block name="p" id="d3e632" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenyans expected no less from
            either one of us. The people have embraced the Accord with joy and renewed hope. We
            believe the Accord is the first step towards achieving a prosperous and stable future
            for all Kenyans. It opens a new chapter in the management of our national
            affairs.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e637" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I believe hon. Members will agree
            that the Accord is a victory for all Kenyans, laying the foundation for peace and
            stability in our country. The successful implementation of the Accord will require
            goodwill, unity, good faith and integrity from this House and all our leaders in this
            country. I urge hon. Members to ensure that all the necessary Bills to implement the
            Accord and other social and economic reforms are dealt with promptly, so that Kenya can
            be fully restored to, and even exceed its former glory.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e642" class="P1"> In this regard, we will, as the Coalition

         </container>
         <block name="p" id="d3e690" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, Kenya has witnessed some and real
            irreversible changes since the year 2003. In the political arena, Kenyans are now
            enjoying their freedoms of association and expression without fear.As a people, we are
            now fully aware of our rights and freedoms to do whatever we want. At times, however, it
            is evident that we are yet to fully comprehend that real freedom and liberty also comes
            with responsibility of ensuring that in enjoying our rights, we do not do harm to
            others. We have made impressive gains in the social sector. We have seen primary school
            enrolment grow by over two million children because of free primary education.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e697" class="P1"> Similarly, secondary school enrolment has almost
            doubled in the last five years because of a higher transition rate and the recent
            introduction of free secondary education.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e702" class="P1"> Moreover, our country is more caring of the weak
            and vulnerable among us. We now have a programme that provides financial support to
            HIV/AIDS affected orphans which will grow from 12,500 participating households to more
            than 30,000 this year.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e708" class="P1"> Children under five, pregnant mothers and patients
            suffering from HIV/AIDS, TB and malaria continue to receive free treatment and drugs in
            all our public health facilities. In addition, our economy has consistently performed
            well with the growth rate rising from 0.2 per cent in the year 2002 to nearly 7 per cent
            last year. All sectors have performed well, with key sectors such as agriculture,
            transport, communications, tourism, manufacturing and trade all growing at an average
            rate of 5 to 10 per cent annually in the last three years. The informal sector has
            received policy attention with the passage of the Microfinance Act to support small and
            medium enterprises.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e713" class="P1"> We have also made progress in building of markets
            to enable street vendors to do their business legally and without harassment. We have,
            as a nation, received commendations for our achievements. These include commendations
            for our improved business environment from the World Bank, and for our public service
            reforms from the United Nations among others.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e718" class="P1"> Indeed, although we continue to face many
            challenges, we have a lot to celebrate about our country and we have created a solid
            foundation on which to build its future.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e723" class="P1"> In this respect, I am confident that we will soon
            overcome the setbacks we have suffered recently and our country will resume its upward
            path in all of development once we begin to implement our Coalition Government
            Programme.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e728" class="P1"> It is for this reason that we have put together a
            high level committee with five members each from both sides to harmonise and highlight
            priority policies and programmes proposed in the PNU, ODM and ODM-K manifestos into a
            joint policy and programme strategy.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e733" class="P1"> This strategy will give priority to activities that
            positively affect the livelihood and conditions of our poor people while promoting
            equitable opportunities for development throughout the country. For instance,
            slum-upgrading, construction of public markets and support to small-scale farmers,
            livestock farmers and operators of small businesses will be accorded top
            priority.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e739" class="P1"> The joint medium term strategy will build on the
            foundations of the successful Economic Recovery Strategy for Wealth and Employment
            Creation. Later this year, we expect to table a Sessional Paper on Vision 2030. The
            Vision represents our collective commitment as Kenyans to transform our country into a
            middle income economy underpinned by political stability, social justice as well as
            equitable economic and social transformation.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e744" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I will now briefly outline our
            Government's legislative and policy proposals in several key sectors. Let me begin by
            thanking the Ninth Parliament</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e749" class="P1">
            <milestone name="eol" id="d3e751"/>for passing 17 Bills into law last year. These
            include The Political Parties Bill, The Constituencies Development Fund Bill, The Media
            Bill and several labour sector laws.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e754" class="P1"> These laws are expected to improve our country's
            social, political and economic environment. However, the Tenth Parliament faces an even
            more pressing agenda and cannot afford to conduct itself in the usual manner. I,
            therefore, expect the House to work twice as hard to achieve the ambitious legislative
            agenda that will be brought to this House.I wish to point out that what I am proposing
            today as the Government's legislative and policy agenda to this House will be augmented
            further in the coming weeks and months. This will be done through new Bills and policies
            that will be developed from the synergy and harmonization of the manifestos of the three
            main parties to the coalition.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e761" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the past five years have seen the
            agricultural sector perform robustly from the policies implemented by the Government.
            We, therefore, expect it to recover quickly from the recent setbacks. To improve market
            performance of several key commodities, we will propose the following legislative and
            policy agenda:-</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e766" class="P14"> 1. To amend the Coffee Act 2001 to provide direct
            sales of coffee.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e772" class="P14">2. To amend the Sugar Act 2001 to restructure the
            sugar industry.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e775" class="P14">3. To introduce Bills and Sessional Papers covering
            dairy, poultry and fishing, industries among others.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e778" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, another sector that has been
            performing extremely well is the tourism industry. Despite the recent downturn, the
            sector has enormous potential to recover and grow rapidly, providing foreign exchange
            and creating employment opportunities. To enable the sector perform even better, the
            Government will table three Bills, namely, the Environmental Impact Assessment
            Regulations Guidelines, the Tourism Bill and the Wildlife Bill.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e783" class="P1"> As we undertake to deal decisively with poverty and
            inequitable development, my Government acknowledges the crucial role played by
            co-operatives in the production and marketing of produce as well as mobilizing savings
            and providing credit to the majority of Kenyans. In this regard, we will be tabling a
            Sessional Paper on Co-operative Development Policy, and a Bill on Savings and Credit
            Co-operatives.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e788" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, while we have done well in
            implementing the free primary and secondary education programmes, we do require
            legislation to entrench the reforms in the entire education sector within our country's
            laws. In this regard, my Government plans to introduce legislation that will regulate
            the role of non-public entities such as the civil society and the international
            education providers, as well as propose the establishment of a Technical Industrial
            Vocation and Entrepreneurial Training Authority.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e793" class="P1"> Moreover, we do recognise that we will not be able
            to achieve the goals of Vision 2030 without entrenching a culture of science, technology
            and innovation in our society. In this regard, my Government will present to the House
            several proposals, including a National Policy for Science, Technology and Innovation, a
            Bill to upgrade the National Council of Science and Technology to the National
            Commission of Science and Technology, and the creation of the National Science
            Foundation and National Innovation Agency.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e799" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, in the health sector, my
            Government proposes to review the Public Health Act, so as to consolidate 23 different
            public health laws into a single Act of Parliament. We will also table in this House
            policy papers on Health Care Financing, Health Services Commission and Decentralised
            Funding of Health Facilities.</block>

         <block name="p" id="d3e806" class="P1"> With regard to the youths of this country, my
            Government will propose amendments to the Armed Forces Act to enable youths trained
            under the National Youth Service to be absorbed into the armed forces. We will also
            table before the House a Bill to provide for the creation of a National Youth Council.
            Further, my Government will re-table the Sessional Paper on Employment Policy for
            discussion in the House on the urgent and critical matter of providing enough jobs for
            our young people.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e811" class="P1">
            <milestone name="eol" id="d3e813"/> Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regard to gender, we will
            continue to support the current policy of ensuring that 30 per cent of public
            appointments and new employment opportunities are reserved for women. We now have more
            lady Members of Parliament than at any other time in the past, and I expect to see more
            gender friendly laws and policies emerge from the Tenth Parliament in relation to its
            predecessors.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e818" class="P1"> With regard to the protection of the family and
            children, we will propose amendments to the Children Act, 2001 for better
            implementation.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e823" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, the proper management and
            regulation of our country's physical infrastructure is among the highest priorities of
            my Government. In this regard, we plan to introduce the Information Communication
            Technology Bill as a regulatory framework for broadcasting, electronic transactions and
            cyber crime.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e829" class="P1"> In the water sector, we will table the National
            Water Harvesting and Storage Policy to facilitate the harnessing and storage of
            recurrent flood waters, as well as the National Shared Water Resources Policy to promote
            equitable development of water resources nationally.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e834" class="P1"> We also expect to undertake the Second Mzima
            Springs Project to ensure sufficient water supply to Mombasa and its surroundings. And
            to ensure that our roads network is better constructed and maintained, my Government
            will make fully operational the Urban, Rural and National Highways Authorities that were
            legislated under the Roads Act in the last Parliament.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e839" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will further introduce a
            policy on the registration of contractors, as well as the creation of a national
            construction company to build capacity among local contractors. We will also introduce
            legislation touching on the protection of road reserves, registration of engineers,
            architects as well as quantity surveyors.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e844" class="P1"> With regard to local authorities, we propose to
            bring to the House, new amendments to the Local Government Act to enable the direct
            election of mayors and county council chairmen. This reform is long overdue, and this
            Parliament should deliberate on it as a matter of priority.</block>

         <block name="p" id="d3e862" class="P1"> To ensure proper planning and development of our
            urban areas, as well as the proper enforcement of laws and bylaws for regulation of
            urban development, we will table in the House proposals to set up a National Urban and
            Metropolitan Areas Authority. To promote the development of affordable housing, we will
            present the Housing Bill and a Landlord and Tenant Bill.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e867" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, with regard to national security,
            my Government will continue to propose legislation and policies that safeguard our
            national security, while also ensuring protection of our people's rights and freedoms.
            We propose to bring to the House several Bills touching on national security.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e872" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, we will table before the House
            the Organised Crimes Bill to contain the emergence of organised gangs and militias which
            bode ill for our society. We will also table the Anti-money Laundering Bill as well as
            introduce amendments to the Chiefs Act and Firearms Act.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e877" class="P1"> Mr. Speaker, Sir, I wish to propose that Hon.
            Members become fully involved in promoting and leading the district peace and
            reconciliation committees. This is necessary because the post-election violence saw
            communal relations stretched to breaking point. Parliament, as the representative body
            of all Kenyans, must now rise to its historic responsibility and play its role fully in
            restoring peace, security as well as law and order in our beloved country.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e882" class="P1"> Hon. Members, you must now become the ambassadors
            of peace and reconciliation in your constituencies, among your communities and
            throughout the country. Kenyans need to hear and be reassured by their political leaders
            that they can live, own property and do business in any part of the country without fear
            of prejudice, harassment or prosecution.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e888" class="P1">
            <milestone name="eol" id="d3e890"/> In this regard, we propose to bring to the House a
            comprehensive policy and accompanying legislation that will ensure that the threat to
            our national security and social cohesion caused by negative ethnicity is neutralised
            for the well being of our country.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e895" class="P1"> As I conclude my remarks, Mr. Speaker, allow me to
            reiterate the need to build and strengthen the capacity of hon. Members to do their
            work. In this regard, I urge the Parliamentary Service Commission to ensure that Members
            are provided with sufficient research and technical assistants as well as computer and
            office facilities during this Session. We have a chance to make the Tenth Parliament a
            meeting of minds and an avenue for a great competition of ideas that will reflect the
            highest levels of constructive debate in our nation's history.</block>

         </container>

         <block name="p" id="d3e916" class="P1"> Finally, Mr. Speaker, I wish hon. Members a highly
            productive Session in which the agenda of building a new Kenya overrides any other
            individual or factional agendas. This is what Kenyans are asking of the Tenth
            Parliament, to undertake its historic task of building a new dispensation for a new
            Kenya.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e921" class="P1"> With these remarks, Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure
            to declare the Second Session of the Tenth Parliament officially open.</block>
         <block name="p" id="d3e926" class="P1"> Thank you and God bless you all. Please succeed and
            forget the history of what has happened, not because you want to put it aside, but
            because you want to do something much better and to improve much better. Welcome, ladies
            and gentlemen.</block>
