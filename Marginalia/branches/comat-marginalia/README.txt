Marginalia
==========

This Plone product integrates the 'marginalia' javascript application
for annotating documents. 'marginalia' is used more or less as-is. The
Plone product both implements the backend (storing and serving
annotations) and hosts the front-end (marginalia runs on documents
served by Plone).
