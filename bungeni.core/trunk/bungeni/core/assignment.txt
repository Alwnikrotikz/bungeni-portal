Group Assignments
-----------------

A facility for assigning a content item to a group, possibly with a workflow to 
the assignment.

First some setup code..

  >>> from bungeni.core import domain, interfaces
  >>> from zope.component import getMultiAdapter
  >>> from ore.alchemist import Session
  >>> from datetime import datetime
  >>> import transaction

To demonstrate let's create some groups and a content object.

  >>> bill = domain.Bill( title=u"terra")
  >>> bill2 = domain.Bill( title=u"firma")
  >>> committee = domain.Committee(short_name=u"Committee", start_date=datetime.now())
  >>> committee2 = domain.Committee(short_name=u"Committee 2", start_date=datetime.now())
  >>> stored = map( Session().save, ( bill, bill2, committee, committee2 ) )
  >>> transaction.commit()

Now we can assign the bill to a committee.

  >>> getMultiAdapter( (bill, committee ), interfaces.IAssignmentFactory).new()
  <bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>

  >>> getMultiAdapter( (bill, committee2 ), interfaces.IAssignmentFactory).new()
  <bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>

  >>> getMultiAdapter( (bill2, committee ), interfaces.IAssignmentFactory).new()
  <bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>

We can now utilize the content assignments adapter to find all the assignments of this
content to any group.

 >>> list( interfaces.IContentAssignments( bill ) )
 [<bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>, <bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>]

Or use the context assignments adapter to find all the assignments of a particular
group.

  >>> list( interfaces.IContextAssignments( committee ) )
  [<bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>, <bungeni.core.assignment.GroupAssignment object at ...>]
