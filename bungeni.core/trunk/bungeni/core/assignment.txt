Group Assignments
-----------------

A facility for assigning a content item to a group, possibly with workflow to 
the assignment.

To demonstrate let's first create some groups and a content object.

  >>> from bungeni.core import domain, interfaces
  >>> from datetime import datetime
  >>> bill = domain.Bill()
  >>> committee = domain.Commitee(short_name="Committee", start_date=datetime.now())
  >>> committee = domain.Commitee(short_name="Committee 2", start_date=datetime.now())

Now we can assign the bill to a committee.

  >>> factory = interfaces.IAssignmentFactory( bill, committee ).new()
  >>> assignment = factory.new() # also takes kw args for constructor

  >>> factory = interfaces.IAssignmentFactory( bill, committee2 ).new()
  >>> factory = interfaces.IAssignmentFactory( bill2, committee ).new()

We can now utilize the content assignments adapter to find all the assignments of this
content to any group.

 >>> list( interfaces.IContentAssignments( bill ) )
 [ <Commitee ...>, <Committee ..>] 

Or use the context assignments adapter to find all the assignments of a particular
group.

 >>> list( interfaces.IContextAssignments( committee ) )
 [ <Bill ...>, <Bill ..>]
