notes 


are all amendments processed with marginala? does openoffice read marginala annotations? 

what kind of volume of bills, questions, and items does a typical parliament see in a year?

do we want to maintain two calendaring storages for, scheduled and actual? i don't have schedule aspects modeling yet.

i'm still unclear on the server storage requirements of the amendment process (specifically bills) and what sort of commonality
can be extracted if any between these and bills/motions

questions 

 - how are supplementary questions to be created in the user interface? from the question or as an option from creating a general question.
 
 
responses

  - responses (p.82) - says respondent is actually the owner of the question, not the user who created the response?
  
  logical question, so questions are asked, scheduled, and a response is read.
  
   
 
what are some aspects

weave these as patterns, integrated as events, utilities and adapters.
